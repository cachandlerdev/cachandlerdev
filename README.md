### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science and engineering student who enjoys working on interesting projects and learning new things.
If you're curious about some of the projects I've worked on, I invite you to take a look at my personal website, since I don't keep *all* of my personal work open source on GitHub.
